					Day 2 of my software engineering imersive. Today we learned about HTML and CSS. The class played a game called <a href ="">Flexbox Froggy</a>. I was the first one to complete the game so I earned a gold star XD. We had a lab where we broke out into groups and built a fake resume site for a cat. We changed some colors made lists added embedded videos and made some other fun edits. I worked with Brynner and Michelle they were very helpful and we solved a lot of problems together. I look forward to working with them more. After our groups ended we were taught how to upload our projects from our local computer to github from the terminal. I understood how to do this already so there was no issue. I am still having trouble understanding what is happing durring a pull request.

				<div class="blogEntry">
					Today was the first day of my General Assembly Software engineering imersive. The first part the day was an introduction to the instructors as well as our classmates in our group. After the introductions there happened to be a global outage for Slack. After a few hours Slack was back and we were able to send and recieve messages. After that we started our first lesson, the Terminal. We installed a few things like homebrew and zsh. I didnt have these installed and was able to set them up without any issues. After that, we installed git and learned how to use git. 
					I already did most of this lesson before the class, so today was a breeze. I am hoping that there is some more challenging things at the end of the week.
